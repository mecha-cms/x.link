use:
  '.\lot\x\layout': 1
...

This extension will convert relative links in anchors and images (and some attributes on other elements that have been
registered in the `.\lot\x\link\state.php` file) into full links.

### Hooks

Data that canâ€™t be detected easily as links because they are outside the HTML markup can be wrapped in this `link` hook,
so that they can be resolved too:

~~~ .php
$kick = '/foo/bar/baz';

header('location: ' . Hook::fire('link', [$kick]));
~~~
