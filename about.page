This extension converts relative links in anchors and images (and some attributes on other elements registered in
`.\lot\x\link\state.php`) to full links.

### Hooks

Other data that is not easily recognized as links because it is outside the HTML markup can be wrapped in this `link`
hook so that it can also be resolved:

~~~ .php
$kick = '/foo/bar/baz';

header('location: ' . Hook::fire('link', [$kick]));
~~~
